## About Project

![alt text](https://api-personal-website.000webhostapp.com/images/projects/wadde-thumb.webp)

I am learning the art of slicing website designs from [shaynakit](https://shaynakit.com/landing). I recently sliced a company profile website design named "Wadde" using Next.js 14 and Tailwind CSS. This slicing process involves converting visual designs into functional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code suitable for web usage. It has provided me with insights into component structures, layout settings, and responsive designs on websites.
